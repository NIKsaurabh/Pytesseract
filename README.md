# Pytesseract
I have used Pytesseract on anaconda which is installed on my ubuntu 20.04 OS. For using Pytesseract in windows we have to set path but in linux just run following command on your terminal and you are ready to roll.

#### sudo apt update
#### sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
#### sudo apt install libtesseract-dev
